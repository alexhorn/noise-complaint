# noise-complaint

Warns you when you're being too loud in voice chat.
Useful if you tend to scream at your Discord friends at night.

## Usage

You need to adjust the `config.ini` to your setup.

1. Set your input and output devices (optional)
2. Set the threshold (varies from microphone to microphone, you'll have to experiment)

Then you can run it by executing `pythonw app.py`.
